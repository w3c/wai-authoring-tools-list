This could be worked around by using other types of content modeling for multilingual content, which is possible but unlikely.",
  "accessible-templates-available-partially-description": "With rich text formatting and StreamField blocks, Wagtail provides templates for basic text content as well as complex formatting like tables. Wagtail also provides templates for form fields within its forms module.

  "alt-available-partially-description": "Wagtail provides alternative text for all images within the CMS, but in five prominent cases the programmatically-associated text isn’t the best possible one.

Comments are displayed as a 'speech bubble' icon next to the field they are associated with. The association isn’t programmatically exposed. Even visually, the presence of a comment can only be identified on hover/focus within the field’s area.<br>- Fail: Comments in rich text. Comments are displayed as highlighted text within the rich text field. The association isn’t programmatically exposed.<br>- Pass: Character count for rich text fields.

  "automatically-checks-partially-description": "There are a number of formatting / content entry options in the CMS that can lead to accessibility issues. The built-in accessibility checker provides automated tests for a number of possible issues, but not all. Available checks are:<br><br>- button-name: button elements must always have a text label.<br>- empty-heading: This rule checks for headings with no text content. Empty headings are confusing to screen readers users and should be avoided.<br>- empty-table-header: Table header text should not be empty<br>- frame-title: iframe elements must always have a text label.<br>- heading-order: This rule checks for incorrect heading order. Headings should be ordered in a logical and consistent manner, with the main heading (h1) followed by subheadings (h2, h3, etc.).<br>- input-button-name: input button elements must always have a text label.<br><br>- link-name: a link elements must always have a text label.<br>- p-as-heading: This rule checks for paragraphs that are styled as headings. Paragraphs should not be styled as headings, as they don’t help users who rely on headings to navigate content.<br>- alt-text-quality: A custom rule ensures that image alt texts don’t contain anti-patterns like file extensions and underscores.<br><br><br>There are a number of success criteria that do not have automated checks nor instructions for manual checking:<br><br>- 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (AA) – instructions and potentially limited automated checks on correct link text (avoid 'click here')<br>- 1.4.5 Images of Text (AA) – instructions on avoiding images of text except for scenarios where there is no alternative<br>- 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only) (AAA) – see above<br>- 1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception) (AAA) – see above<br>- 3.1.5 Reading Level (AAA) – instructions for manual checking or automated checks<br>- 2.4.10 Section Headings (AAA) – instructions for manual checking or automated checks<br>- 3.3.5 Help (AAA) – instructions for manual checking or automated checks for the form builder<br><br><br>All of Wagtail’s checks are pass/fail and as such require no author input.
